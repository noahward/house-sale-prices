# House Sale Price Predictions
- Dataset included a variety of house attributes including the final sale price
- Dataset attributes were explored, manipulated, cleaned and visualized during the Exploratory Data Analysis
- Goal was to train our models based upon these attributes, and find a model that best predicts final sale price
- These three models were chosen and tested due to a combonation of their speed and accuracy for predicting numeric values:
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Gradient Boosting Regression
    3. Random Forest Regression
